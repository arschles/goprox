# go-git-http

This package was taken from https://github.com/AaronO/go-git-http and adapted. I (@arschles) have
vendored it here so I can more easily make modifications, and I'll submit changes upstream when
I get it to a more stable state.

THe `LICENSE` file in this directory applies to everything in this package.
